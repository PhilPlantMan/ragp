Lack of a natural underlying metric for comparing such alphabetic data significantly inhibits sophisticated statistical analyses of sequences, modeling structural and functional aspects of proteins, and related problems. Herein, we use multivariate statistical analyses on almost 500 amino acid attributes to produce a small set of highly interpretable numeric patterns of amino acid variability. These high-dimensional attribute data are summarized by five multidimensional patterns of attribute covariation that reflect polarity, secondary structure, molecular volume, codon diversity, and electrostatic charge. Numerical scores for each amino acid then transform amino acid sequences for statistical analyses. Relationships between transformed data and amino acid substitution matrices show significant associations for polarity and codon diversity scores. Transformed alphabetic data are used in analysis of variance and discriminant analysis to study DNA binding in the basic helix-loop-helix proteins. The transformed scores offer a general solution for analyzing a wide variety of sequence analysis problems.},

This impairs predictions of 5-10\% of the proteome, hence this is an important issue in protein annotation. To address this problem, we previously designed a hidden Markov model, Phobius, that combines transmembrane topology and signal peptide predictions.

	doi = {10.1104/pp.103.023580},
	abstract = {Posttranslational glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchoring is common not only for animal and fungal but also for plant proteins. The attachment of the GPI moiety to the carboxyl-terminus after proteolytic cleavage of a C-terminal propeptide is performed by the transamidase complex. Its four known subunits also have obvious full-length orthologs in the Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) genomes; thus, the mechanism of substrate protein processing appears similar for all eukaryotes. A learning set of plant proteins (substrates for the transamidase complex) has been collected both from the literature and plant sequence databases. We find that the plant GPI lipid anchor motif differs in minor aspects from the animal signal (e.g. the plant hydrophobic tail region can contain a higher fraction of aromatic residues). We have developed the "big-Pi plant" program for prediction of compatibility of query protein C-termini with the plant GPI lipid anchor motif requirements. Validation tests show that the sensitivity for transamidase targets is approximately 94\%, and the rate of false positive prediction is about 0.1\%. Thus, the big-Pi predictor can be applied as unsupervised genome annotation and target selection tool. The program is also suited for the design of modified protein constructs to test their GPI lipid anchoring capacity. The big-Pi plant predictor Web server and lists of potential plant precursor proteins in Swiss-Prot, SPTrEMBL, Arabidopsis, and rice proteomes are available at http://mendel.imp.univie.ac.at/gpi/plants/gpi\_plants.html.

A HMMER web server (http://hmmer.janelia.org) has been designed and implemented such that most protein database searches return within a few seconds. Methods are available for searching either a single protein sequence, multiple protein sequence alignment or profile HMM against a target sequence database, and for searching a protein sequence against Pfam. The web server is designed to cater to a range of different user expertise and accepts batch uploading of multiple queries at once. All search methods are also available as RESTful web services, thereby allowing them to be readily integrated as remotely executed tasks in locally scripted workflows. We have focused on minimizing search times and the ability to rapidly display tabular results, regardless of the number of matches found, developing graphical summaries of the search results to provide quick, intuitive appraisement of them.},

This superfamily consists of three members: hyperglycosylated arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), moderately glycosylated extensins (EXTs), and lightly glycosylated proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Hybrid and chimeric versions of HRGP molecules also exist. In order to “mine” genomic databases for HRGPs and to facilitate and guide research in the field, the BIO OHIO software program was developed that identifies and classifies AGPs, EXTs, PRPs, hybrid HRGPs, and chimeric HRGPs from proteins predicted from DNA sequence data. This bioinformatics program is based on searching for biased amino acid compositions and for particular protein motifs associated with known HRGPs. HRGPs identified by the program are subsequently analyzed to elucidate the following: (1) repeating amino acid sequences, (2) signal peptide and glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchor addition sequences, (3) similar HRGPs via Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, (4) expression patterns of their genes, (5) other HRGPs, glycosyl transferase, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and peroxidase genes coexpressed with their genes, and (6) gene structure and whether genetic mutants exist in their genes. The program was used to identify and classify 166 HRGPs from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as follows: 85 AGPs (including classical AGPs, lysine-rich AGPs, arabinogalactan peptides, fasciclin-like AGPs, plastocyanin AGPs, and other chimeric AGPs), 59 EXTs (including SP5 EXTs, SP5/SP4 EXTs, SP4 EXTs, SP4/SP3 EXTs, a SP3 EXT, “short” EXTs, leucine-rich repeat-EXTs, proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases, and other chimeric EXTs), 18 PRPs (including PRPs and chimeric PRPs), and AGP/EXT hybrid HRGPs.},

The study of IDPs is a rapidly growing area as the crucial biological functions of more of these proteins are uncovered. In plants, IDPs are implicated in plant stress responses, signaling, and regulatory processes. A superfamily of cell wall proteins, the hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), have characteristic features of IDPs. Their protein backbones are rich in the disordering amino acid proline, they contain repeated sequence motifs and extensive posttranslational modifications (glycosylation), and they have been implicated in many biological functions. HRGPs are evolutionarily ancient, having been isolated from the protein-rich walls of chlorophyte algae to the cellulose-rich walls of embryophytes. Examination of HRGPs in a range of plant species should provide valuable insights into how they have evolved. Commonly divided into the arabinogalactan proteins, extensins, and proline-rich proteins, in reality, a continuum of structures exists within this diverse and heterogenous superfamily. An inability to accurately classify HRGPs leads to inconsistent gene ontologies limiting the identification of HRGP classes in existing and emerging omics data sets. We present a novel and robust motif and amino acid bias () bioinformatics pipeline to classify HRGPs into 23 descriptive subclasses. Validation of  was achieved using available genomic resources and then applied to the 1000 Plants transcriptome project (www.onekp.com) data set.

Since the introduction of BLAST in the 1990's, important theoretical advances in homology search methodology have been made using probabilistic inference methods and hidden Markov models (HMMs). However, previous software implementations of these newer probabilistic methods were slower than BLAST by about 100-fold. This hindered their utility, because computation speed is so critical with the rapidly increasing size of modern sequence databases. Here I describe the acceleration methods I implemented in a new, freely available profile HMM software package, HMMER3.

	abstract = {The UniProt knowledgebase is a large resource of protein sequences and associated detailed annotation. The database contains over 60 million sequences, of which over half a million sequences have been curated by experts who critically review experimental and predicted data for each protein. The remainder are automatically annotated based on rule systems that rely on the expert curated knowledge. Since our last update in 2014, we have more than doubled the number of reference proteomes to 5631, giving a greater coverage of taxonomic diversity. We implemented a pipeline to remove redundant highly similar proteomes that were causing excessive redundancy in UniProt. The initial run of this pipeline reduced the number of sequences in UniProt by 47 million. For our users interested in the accessory proteomes, we have made available sets of pan proteome sequences that cover the diversity of sequences for each species that is found in its strains and sub-strains. To help interpretation of genomic variants, we provide tracks of detailed protein information for the major genome browsers. We provide a SPARQL endpoint that allows complex queries of the more than 22 billion triples of data in UniProt (http://sparql.uniprot.org/). UniProt resources can be accessed via the website at http://www.uniprot.org/.},

	abstract = {The seqinR package for the R environment is a library of utilities to retrieve and analyze biological sequences. It provides an interface between: (i) the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, and (ii) the ACNUC sequence retrieval system for nucleotide and protein sequence databases such as GenBank, EMBL, SWISS-PROT. ACNUC is very efficient in providing direct access to subsequences of biological interest (e.g., protein coding regions, tRNA, or rRNA coding regions) present in GenBank and in EMBL. Thanks to a simple query language, it is then easy under R to select sequences of interest and then use all the power of the R environment to analyze them. The ACNUC databases can be locally installed but they are more conveniently accessed through a web server to take advantage of centralized daily updates. The aim of this chapter is to provide a handout on basic sequence analyses under seqinR with a special focus on multivariate methods.},

	abstract = {A method is presented for locating protein antigenic determinants by analyzing amino acid sequences in order to find the point of greatest local hydrophilicity. This is accomplished by assigning each amino acid a numerical value (hydrophilicity value) and then repetitively averaging these values along the peptide chain. The point of highest local average hydrophilicity is invariably located in, or immediately adjacent to, an antigenic determinant. It was found that the prediction success rate depended on averaging group length, with hexapeptide averages yielding optimal results. The method was developed using 12 proteins for which extensive immunochemical analysis has been carried out and subsequently was used to predict antigenic determinants for the following proteins: hepatitis B surface antigen, influenza hemagglutinins, fowl plague virus hemagglutinin, human histocompatibility antigen HLA-B7, human interferons, Escherichia coli and cholera enterotoxins, ragweed allergens Ra3 and Ra5, and streptococcal M protein. The hepatitis B surface antigen sequence was synthesized by chemical means and was shown to have antigenic activity by radioimmunoassay.},

	abstract = {GPI-anchors constitute a very important post-translational modification, linking many proteins to the outer face of the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. Since experimental validation of GPI-anchoring signals is slow and costly, computational approaches for predicting them from amino acid sequences are needed. However, the most recent GPI predictor is more than a decade old and considerable progress has been made in machine learning since then. We present a new dataset and a novel method, NetGPI, for GPI signal prediction. NetGPI is based on recurrent neural networks, incorporating an attention mechanism that simultaneously detects GPI-anchoring signals and points out the location of their ω-sites. The performance of NetGPI is superior to existing methods with regards to discrimination between GPI-anchored proteins and other secretory proteins and approximate (±1 position) placement of the ω-site. NetGPI is available at: https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetGPI. The code repository is available at: https://github.com/mhgislason/netgpi-1.1.}
